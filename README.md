# BOTest
Paste Test Project

The vending machine program was written in PL/SQL and can be run from SQL PLUS prompt.

The API automation task was written in Java, using Cucumber Gherkin within a Maven project.

The test was run successfully on the Eclipse IDE and on the command prompt with the 'mvn test' command.

I have added a comprehensive Read Me file to the Project folder, this explains each section of the code; both the PL/SQL and Java.
